1. On every new page, write the page number on a line of its own. 
 - It should be just the page number, no other characters.
 - For double pages, write the two numbers connected by a dash.

2. Place every translated text on a line of its own.
 - Text should be placed in reading order.
 - Type text exactly as it's supposed to appear (i.e. don't surround by quotes, don't prepend by text type or character speaking etc.)
 - If there are connected bubbles, either separate the text by // for each bubble or place each text on a new line
 - Conversely, do not add new lines for text that should go together. The typesetter will manually insert line breaks if appropriate.
 - You may include specifics in quotes when it's ambiguous where the text should go - just make it obvious that the text should be removed.
 - If the text is just a number, make sure to add some other character too, otherwise it will be interpreted as the start of a new page.

3. Insert a blank line whenever you move to a new panel. This makes it easier to read the script and to determine where text should go.

4. Don't include comments in the final script
 - You may leave in translator notes if you wish them to be typeset. Keep in mind that we like to keep those to a minimum and only include notes when they provide useful information as opposed to personal opinion.
